# 2017 FRC STEAMworks Score Sheet

https://nicholsschool.github.io/2017-Score-Sheet/

This is a quickly made example of how scoring works. I made some assuptions which are likely wrong.

* Seconds listed are an approximation based on the boiler being able to accomdate and score 5 fuels per second on either the high goal or the low goal.
* As I currently understand it, the rotors which are spinning at T=0 at the end of autonomous are counted.
* Then, if the same rotors which began spinning in autonomous continue to spin at T=0 at the end of teleop, they are counted a second time.
* Within the Score Sheet, Fouls and Technical Fouls are subtractive from the point score, however in the real game they are additive to the opposing team's score.
