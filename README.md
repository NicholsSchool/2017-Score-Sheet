# 2017 FRC STEAMworks Score Sheet

https://nicholsschool.github.io/2017-Score-Sheet/

This is a quickly made example of how scoring works. I made some assuptions which are likely wrong.

* Seconds listed are an approximation based on the boiler being able to accomdate and score 5 fuels per second on either the high goal or the low goal.
* As I currently understand it, the rotors which are spinning at T=0 at the end of autonomous are counted. If the same rotors which began spinning in autonomous continue to spin at T=0 at the end of teleop, they are currently counted a second time.
